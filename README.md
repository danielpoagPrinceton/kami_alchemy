# Kami Alchemy
A game proof of concept made as a creative project for REL323: Japanese Mythology

Inspired by games like [Little Alchemy](https://littlealchemy.com/), this is a game where you generate new Kami (as drawn from the Kojiki) through the interactions of the Kami you have.

As this is a proof of concept, I have not been exhaustive. I include only as many Kami as necessary to demonstrate the idea of the game.
